Movie Recommendation System 
This Python project implements a movie recommendation system using the Surprise library. It provides personalized movie recommendations for users based on their historical movie ratings. The recommendation algorithm used in this project is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Key Features:
Data Preparation: The project retrieves the MovieLens 1M dataset, a widely used movie rating dataset, and loads it into the system. User ratings are used to generate recommendations.

SVD Recommendation: The system utilizes the SVD algorithm to create movie recommendations for users. SVD is a matrix factorization technique that captures latent factors contributing to user preferences and item characteristics.

User Interaction: Users can input their User ID to receive personalized movie recommendations. The system identifies movies the user has not rated and suggests the top-rated movies based on the SVD predictions.

Movie Information: The project also provides additional movie information, such as movie titles and genres, enhancing the user experience and helping users make informed choices.

Top-N Recommendations: The system generates and displays a list of the top movie recommendations for the user, typically the top 10 movies with the highest predicted ratings.

This project is a practical example of collaborative filtering in recommendation systems and can be used as a foundation for building more sophisticated recommendation engines. Users can explore new movies they might enjoy based on their historical preferences, making it a valuable tool for movie enthusiasts.

To get started, simply enter your User ID and receive personalized movie recommendations. Happy movie watching!
